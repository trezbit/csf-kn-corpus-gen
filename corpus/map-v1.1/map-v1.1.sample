The IEC 62443-2-1:2009 security control 4.3.3.3.9 focuses mainly on industrial automation and control systems security. It provides guidelines and requirements for establishing a system security management plan that covers the security aspects of the system lifecycle. The standard is made up of various parts, with 2-1 specifically addressing the requirements for security management systems.

Key concepts covered by the 62443-2-1:2009 security control 4.3.3.3.9 involve:

1. **Security Policies and Procedures**: It stresses the need for documented security policies and procedures that guide the organization in managing and protecting its industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) environments from cybersecurity threats. This includes the identification of asset owners, defining security roles and responsibilities, incident response, and recovery procedures.

2. **Risk Management**: Emphasizes the importance of risk assessment and risk management processes tailored for the operational technology environment. This involves identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with cybersecurity threats to the industrial control systems.

3. **System Security Management Plan**: Implementation of a comprehensive security plan that addresses the security throughout the lifecycle of the system, from the design phase through decommissioning. This plan should include measures for security event monitoring, access control, incident response, and continuity of operations.

Overlap with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Versions 1.1 and 2.0:

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, both versions 1.1 and the anticipated version 2.0, share common objectives and controls with IEC 62443-2-1:2009, focusing on improving the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure. Some key areas of overlap include:

- **Identify (ID)**: Similar to the IEC's emphasis on security policies and risk management, the NIST CSF's Identify function focuses on understanding cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities. This includes asset management, governance, and risk assessment practices that are crucial in both frameworks.

- **Protect (PR)**: This function of the NIST CSF parallels the IEC's requirement for establishing protective measures to ensure continuity and integrity of critical industrial control systems operations. This involves access control, awareness and training, data security, and maintenance of security protective layers in an organization’s systems and infrastructure.

- **Detect (DE)**: Both NCSF and IEC 62443 stress the importance of timely and effective detection of cybersecurity events and anomalies. This includes monitoring security events and conducting continuous security monitoring to identify potentially malicious activity.

- **Respond (RS)**: This correlates with the IEC’s requirement for incident response and recovery procedures. The NIST CSF outlines how organizations should respond to detected cybersecurity incidents with response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation, and improvements.

- **Recover (RC)**: Similar to the IEC's recommendation for a system security management plan that includes recovery actions, the NIST CSF's Recover function focuses on restoring impaired services and capabilities after a cybersecurity incident.

In conclusion, while IEC 62443-2-1:2009 is specifically tailored towards the unique needs and challenges of industrial control systems and operational technology, its key concepts and control requirements share significant common ground with the broader principles outlined in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Both frameworks highlight the need for comprehensive risk management, security policies, incident response mechanisms, and a continuous improvement approach to cybersecurity within critical infrastructure environments.
