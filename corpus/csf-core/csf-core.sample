As of my last update in April 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) version 2.0 had not been published, so I cannot provide details specific to version 2.0 or the changes to control DE.AE-02. However, I can offer insights into the evolution of the framework based on established patterns from NIST and general cybersecurity best practices that might influence the update from version 1.1 to version 2.0, especially regarding control DE.AE-2 from version 1.1.

In NIST CSF version 1.1, DE.AE-2 concerns the analysis of detected events to understand better the activities that might impact the security of an organization. The key concepts revolve around the identification, analysis, and understanding of potential security incidents to support timely and effective responses.

**Key Concepts Likely to Be Expanded in Version 2.0:**

1. **Enhanced Analytical Techniques**: Version 2.0 might emphasize more sophisticated analysis techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), to better identify and understand complex cyber threats. The guidance may suggest implementing anomaly detection systems that learn from network behavior to better identify deviations that could indicate a security incident.

2. **Integration with Threat Intelligence**: The integration of threat intelligence to enhance the analysis of potential adverse events likely will be a key concept. By leveraging data about emerging threats, organizations can improve their capacity to interpret detected events in the context of broader cyber threat landscapes.

3. **Automated Response**: With the advancing complexity and volume of cybersecurity threats, the updated framework might place more emphasis on the automation of event analysis and the preliminary steps in incident response. Automation can help organizations respond more quickly and efficiently to identified threats.

4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Version 2.0 could expand on the need for in-depth root cause analysis of security incidents to prevent future occurrences. This involves not just identifying and mitigating the immediate threat but also understanding and addressing the underlying vulnerabilities that allowed the incident to occur.

5. **Collaboration and Information Sharing**: An emphasis on collaborating with other entities and participating in information-sharing communities to enhance the collective understanding and analysis of adverse events might be a focal point. This approach can provide valuable insights from a diverse set of experiences and perspectives, improving event analysis and response strategies.

6. **Specific Contextual Analysis**: The updated framework might guide analyzing events within the specific context of the organization's operational environment. Understanding how an event impacts specific business processes or functions can help tailor the response strategy to minimize impact effectively.

7. **Compliance and Legal Considerations**: Enhanced guidance on the analysis of events in light of compliance requirements and legal obligations could be a key addition. Organizations must navigate the complex landscape of data protection laws and industry regulations, and understanding the legal implications of a security event is crucial.

**Implementation and Policy Development Guidance:**

For effective implementation, organizations are encouraged to develop clear policies and procedures that define roles, responsibilities, and processes for the analysis of detected cybersecurity events. Training and awareness programs should ensure that all relevant personnel are equipped to recognize and appropriately respond to potential security incidents. Additionally, maintaining up-to-date documentation and leveraging state-of-the-art security tools and technologies will be essential for effective event analysis.

Please, keep in mind that for the most current information and specific details regarding NIST CSF version 2.0 and control DE.AE-02, itâ€™s best to consult directly with NIST publications and resources once they become available.
